Project Instructions: Our project is just a simple game of Tic Tac Toe that everyone played when they were kids. For this game, a yellow dot in the middle of one of the nine squares represents what box is going to be "marked" with an X or an O. In order to move from one box to another, the user should use the left and right buttons. Once the desired box is marked with the yellow circle, the user should click the top/up button to place on X if they are player one or an O if they are player two. Once one of the two players gets three X's or O's in a row, the screen will show what player has won and the game will need to be reset to play again. If it is a tie, meaning no player got three in a row, a message will appear that says no player won and the game will again need to be reset to play again.

My role in the project: I helped in the preparation of the experiment which was researching what other projects were done on youtube and determining what project would be a good one for us to do and what aspects we should include of other projects similar to ours. I then helped with the coding that we did in class when Jack and I worked on it together. After we were finished, I made the youtube video and wrote the write up dealing with what our project did. 

Workload Breakdown: Jack and I both worked on the project in class together and wrote the majority of the code during this time, and we almost finished in class, but we couldn't get the correct square to be selected at all times. Jack offered to take it back and finish this problem by himself, which he did. Because of this, I feel like Jack spent more time on the project than I did, so I would say that he did 65 percent of the work which leaves me with 35 percent of the work. I believe that I helped make up for this difference by doing the youtube video and project description outside of class, but I do believe that Jack did more for the project than I did, considering he is better at coding than I am.

What I learned from the project: From this project, I learned how to apply several applications that I learned throughout the semester. Some of these applications include: changing the colors and sizes of shapes, using the alert buttons on the board to move an object on the display, adding text on the display board, and how to check for a scenario (ex: Player One winning). In total, I gained a better knowledge of how to code from this project. 

Suggestions: One suggestion I have for this course is for the instructions to be better in some of the labs. A couple labs were confusing and I felt that the instructions posted online were vague. Some advice I would have for a future student taking this lab is that this lab is actually pretty enjoyable and something to not dread and instead enjoy.
